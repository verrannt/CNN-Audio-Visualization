# CNN Sound Visualization

Attempt to visualize layers/learned representations of CNN trained on sound data using DeepDream approaches.
Current __work in progress__. Public only because I'm not paying for github. <3

Repos used so far:
+ __sound-cnn__: Simple CNN used for classifying sound data https://github.com/awjuliani/sound-cnn
+ __tensorflow-vgg__: Tensorflow implementation of VGG16 architecture https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg/blob/master/vgg16.py

### Changelog:
##### v0.1:
  + Implemented simplified VGG16 architecture: CNN with 5 convolutional layers, 2 fully-connected layers.
